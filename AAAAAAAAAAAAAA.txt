I need to find the minimum number of candies Pratya should initially select to avoid crying during her bus journey, where she observes milestones with numbers written on them. I will simulate her actions as she adds, removes, or eats candies based on the differences between consecutive milestone numbers. 
I will keep track of the minimum number of candies in her collection (mnC) and the minimum number of candies in her bag (mnB) and ensure these values remain non-negative. If both mnC and mnB are non-negative at any point, it will mean Pratya doesn't need to cry, and I will print "1". If mnB becomes non-positive, indicating an impossibility to maintain the collection, I will print "-1". In other cases, I will calculate how many more candies she needs (use) and how many need to be exchanged between her bag and collection (chng) to maintain a positive collection. If use exceeds N or chng is negative, indicating an impossibility, I will print "-1".

I need to find the minimum number of candies Pratya should initially select to avoid crying during her journey. To do this, I will analyze the changes in her candy collection as she encounters milestones, ensuring that her collection remains non-empty. I will keep track of the minimum number of candies in her collection (mnC) and the minimum number of candies in her bag (mnB) and ensure these values remain non-negative. If both mnC and mnB are non-negative at any point, it will mean Pratya doesn't need to cry, and I will print "1". If this is not possible, I will prints "-1." In cases where a solution exists, I will calculate the minimum initial candy count needed. 

Let's create a C++ template.

I will read the inputs now.

Now I will initialize the counts for Pratya's candy collection (`colc`) and her bag of candies (`bag`). I will also initialize minimum values for the collection (`mnC`) and the bag (`mnB`). 

Let's calculate the difference `dif` between the current milestone number `nxt` and the previous milestone number `prev`. If `dif` is not zero, I will update Pratya's candy collection `colc` by adding `dif` candies and reduce the candies in her bag `bag` by `dif` as well. If `dif` is zero means Pratya is bored, so one candy will be removed from her collection. The `mnC` and `mnB` will keep track of the minimum values of `colc` and `bag` throughout the process. Finally, `prev` will be updated to the current milestone number for the next iteration.

If both mnC and mnB are non-negative at any point, it will mean Pratya doesn't need to cry, and I will print "1". If mnB becomes non-positive, indicating an impossibility to maintain the collection, I will print "-1". In other cases, I will calculate how many more candies she needs (use) and how many need to be exchanged between her bag and collection (chng) to maintain a positive collection. If use exceeds N or chng is negative, indicating an impossibility, I will print "-1".

Let`s test the samples.
----------------
Pratya starts with 15 candies (initial selection) and sees the first milestone with the number 2.
Since 2 is less than 15, she removes 13 candies from her initial selection to have 2 candies in her collection.
She encounters the next milestone with the number 3. To accommodate this milestone, she adds 1 candy to her collection, making it 3. Finally, when she reaches the milestone with the number 4, she eats one candy from her collection to match the milestone number. At the end of the game, Pratya didn't cry, and she used 1 candy from her initial selection.
----------------

correct.

Let`s come up with another test with minimal inputs to make sure there`s no runtime errors.

As there is no overflow case or no corner case, I will test a custom test for random inputs to check the correctness of I will and also to check if I will provides a output for a random input without giving any errors of typos.

I will submit now.

REVIEW:
The high level solution at the beginning is sufficiently detailed. All I will is preceded by an explanation. All the custom cases has a motivation and also the analysis was good.

REJECT:
-> Everything(code) you have written after this block, was not explained. 

HONEYPOT:
This description is not associated with the problem. It seems like the decription is for a different problem.

I can neither solve this problem nor skip.
